                    <h5>History</h5>
                    <p>
                        The university was originally conceived to be the first culture-based university in Bangladesh, but the University Act of 2006 made it a general university with a special focus on liberal arts education and activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mohammad Shamsur Rahman was the first vice-chancellor of JKKNIU. Its first batch consisted of 185 students.The academic programme of the university started effective from 3 June 2007 with three departments under the Faculty of Arts (Bengali Language & Literature, English Language & Literature, and Music) and the single department Computer Science and Engineering under the Faculty of Science and Engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>Two more departments were established the next year under two new faculties: the Department of Accounting and Information Systems under the Faculty of Business Administration and the Department of Economics under the Faculty of Social Science.
                    </p>

                    <p>Two other departments were opened in the academic year 2009â€“2010 under two faculties: the Department of Finance and Banking under the Faculty of Business Administration and the Department of Fine Arts under the Faculty of Arts.

                    <p>The existing system of the Dolon-Chanpa Hall management is tedious process. Up to now there is no extensible software availability for this process. The existing system is run manually by entering data in registers and keeping track of the data in the registers. Adding, searching is quite difficult by this manual process, since it involves work load and time consumption. By this project, we can easily manage the hall details, students records, employees records, mess expenditure, mess bill calculation, easy way of room allocation and hall attendance.</p>
                    <p>The outcome of Hostel Management System is to create a program which is used in Hostels to Keep record. It is a web based system that is designed to manage the hall details, students
